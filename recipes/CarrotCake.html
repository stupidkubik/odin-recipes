    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I've tried many carrot cakes, and this is my favorite recipe.
        If you don't like pecans, feel free to leave them out.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1¼ cups vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 cups grated carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, beat together eggs, oil, white sugar
            and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Mix in flour, baking soda,
            baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Stir in carrots.
            Fold in pecans. Pour into prepared pan.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes,
            or until a toothpick inserted into the center
            of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes,
            then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.</li>

        <li>To Make Frosting: In a medium bowl, combine butter,
            cream cheese, confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla.
            Beat until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Stir in chopped pecans.
            Frost the cooled cake.</li>
    </ol>
