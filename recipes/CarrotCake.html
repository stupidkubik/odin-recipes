    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="styled">Many summers ago, I spent a few wonderful weeks at the Côte d’Azur 
        with my aunt, uncle and cousins. We stayed at a beautiful house 
        in the middle of the green hills around Grasse, a picturesque town 
        which is also called the world’s capital of perfume. I think I wrote 
        about this trip last year but after almost 500 posts I’m losing track! 
        Never mind, I often sat with the girls of the family, my aunt and two cousins, 
        at the pool in the garden. It was a little French paradise with all kinds 
        of flowers, lavender, jasmine and roses turned this place into the most 
        fragrant oasis. We had our girl chats, chilled, swam and ate, a perfect holiday!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="styled">
        <li>rustic French baguette around 25cm</li>
        <li>olive oil 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>chèvre, very thinly sliced, 70g</li>
        <li>cherry tomatoes, cut in half, about 6</li>
        <li>black olives 6</li>
        <li>garlic, thinly sliced, 1 clove</li>
        <li>fresh thyme leaves, from a small handful of sprigs</li>
        <li>pecorino, freshly grated, 2 generous tablespoons</li>
        <li>black peppercorns, crushed in a mortar</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="styled">
        <li>Set the oven to 220°C</li>

        <li>Place the bottom half of the baguette on the lined tray, 
            brush the bread with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and spread 
            the chèvre and then the tomatoes and olives on top.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle with the remaining olive oil, thyme, garlic, 
            pepper and pecorino. Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes 
            or until the cheese is melted and the tomatoes are soft.</li>

        <li>You can also bake the top half of the baguette for the last 
            few minutes. When it’s done, sprinkle with a little fresh thyme, 
            season with salt (if necessary) and enjoy!</li>
