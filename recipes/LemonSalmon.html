    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="styled">We love breakfast for dinner, and there's nothing like eating an egg 
        sandwich while binge watching your favorite Netflix show. 
        Cheese, Italian bread, and hot sauce take this sandwich to the next level.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="styled">
        <li>2 bell peppers, cut into 1 ½ inch strips</li>
        <li>½ large onion, cut into 1 ½ inch strips</li>
        <li>7 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        <li>Grated cheese to taste</li>
        <li>1 loaf Italian bread from your favorite local bakery</li>
        <li>Hot sauce to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="styled">
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a whisk and season 
            with half the salt and half the black pepper.</li>

        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil. 
            Add sliced peppers and onions along with the remaining salt 
            and black pepper. If you don’t want your vegetables 
            to be blackened at the edges, turn the heat down to medium 
            or medium-low. Cook until the veggies are your desired tenderness, 
            5 to 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Turn the heat down to medium if you haven’t already. 
            Add 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet and let it melt.</li>

        <li>Add the beaten eggs to the skillet and cook, stirring almost 
            continuously with a fork or spatula, until they’re fluffy 
            and scrambled but still a little soft, roughly 2 to 4 minutes. 
            Because the eggs are scrambled with vegetables, they’re not going 
            to be as fluffy as they may be if you made them in a skillet by themselves - 
            but don't worry, they'll still taste delicious. Remove from the heat 
            and sprinkle with cheese.</li>

        <li>Cut the loaf of bread in half lengthwise and open it. 
            Cut the loaf crosswise into three 5- to 6-inch portions. 
            Using your fingertips, scoop out some of the bread from the crust 
            to make space for the peppers and eggs and reserve the bread 
            for bread crumbs another day. If desired, slather the cut sides 
            of the bread with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.</li>

        <li>Pile the eggs and peppers on the bread. Serve the sandwiches 
            immediately with hot sauce to taste.</li>
