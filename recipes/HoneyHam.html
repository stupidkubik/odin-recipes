    <h1>Honey Glazed Ham</h1>
    <img src="../images/HoneyHam.jpeg" alt="photo Honey Glazed Ham">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This ham tastes very much like the famous honey baked ham but 
        costs much less, and there's no need to fight the crowds at 
        holiday time. You can even buy the ham presliced to make it 
        easier and more like the original. It is very good. 
        (I do this while preparing the rest of the meal in the kitchen 
        so that I don't forget to baste!)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (5 pound) ready-to-eat ham</li>
        <li>¼ cup whole cloves</li>
        <li>¼ cup dark corn syrup</li>
        <li>2 cups honey</li>
        <li>⅔ cup butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Score ham, and stud with the whole cloves. Place ham in foil lined pan.</li>

        <li>In the top half of a double boiler, 
            heat the corn syrup, honey and butter. Keep glaze warm while baking ham.</li>

        <li>Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes 
            in the preheated oven. Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes 
            with the honey glaze. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, 
            turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, 
            and let sit a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
